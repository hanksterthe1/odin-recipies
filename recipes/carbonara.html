    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti or linguine</li>
        <li>8 ounces pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt, for pasta water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until crispy and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, add the hot drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and immediately pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing continuously. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Season with additional black pepper and serve immediately, topped with extra grated cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
