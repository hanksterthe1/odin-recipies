    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110°F)</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Pour the yeast mixture and oil into the well. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place it in a greased loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Cover and let it rise again for 30-45 minutes until it rises above the pan.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
